            <h3 class="section-header">Indians Supporting the War</h3>
            <p class="section-text">On September 26, 1914, the Lahore Division arrived in Marseilles, France. The French
                initially mistook the Gorkhas for Japanese and referred to them as "Les Hindous. When the Indian
                soldiers arrived, the British Expeditionary Force was barely holding the Ypres Salient, a 38-mile
                stretch between the Belgians and the French, after being exhausted by the retreat from Mons to Marne and
                the advance to the Aisne, suffering 10,000 casualties and facing severe shortages in artillery.</p>
            <p class="section-text">In September and October 1914, the critical battles of the Marne and Ypres were
                pivotal in preventing a German victory. If the Germans had succeeded in their assaults, particularly
                along Menin Road or at Neuve Chapelle, they could have forced a British withdrawal from the continent.
                The Indian Army played a crucial role in saving the British Expeditionary Force. By December 1914,
                Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry arrived in Europe, followed by the 1st Canadian Division,
                which landed in France on January 14, 1915.</p>
            <p class="section-text">Over 135,000 British Indian Army troops fought alongside Canadian forces on the
                Western Front in battles such as 2nd Ypres, St. Julian, Festubert, The Somme, and Vimy. If Indian troops
                from the Lahore Division hadn't arrived in Belgium in 1914, the Germans would have seized the ports,
                preventing the Canadian Expeditionary Force from landing on the European mainland. John McCraeâ€™s poem In
                Flanders Fields would never have been written, highlighting the crucial role of British and Indian
                soldiers in the first battle of Ypres and their collaboration with Canadians in the second battle.</p>

        <div class="col-span-full battle-section">
            <h3 class="section-header">Guts, Glory, and Izzat</h3>
            <p class="section-text">The Indian Army Corps, wearing tropical uniforms, endured one of the harshest
                winters on record while fighting in major battles across Europe from 1914 to 1916. Despite being in
                unfamiliar land, facing an unknown enemy, and fighting for a cause not their own, they served with honor
                for their country and regiments, embodying the spirit of "IZZAT" (honor). - Major Gordon Corrigan</p>
            <p class="section-text">"Izzat" was a key motivating factor for Indian soldiers during World War I, helping
                them overcome challenges that Western soldiers did not face. It is a complex concept that goes beyond
                just honor or face, encompassing both external and internal elements. Externally, it includes
                promotions, rank, medals, marriage, wealth, and land, all of which contribute to one's Izzat.
                Internally, it involves a sense of self-respect, duty, reputation, and pride. The concept of Izzat is
                woven into nearly every story from the war, influencing soldiers at personal, community, and regimental
                levels.</p>

        <div class="col-span-full battle-section">
            <h3 class="section-header">Europe Indian Army Corps</h3>
            <p class="section-text">Indian Army Corps soldiers in World War I faced immense challenges, fighting in
                unfamiliar European lands and harsh, freezing winters without adequate training or proper uniforms until
                early 1915. They endured piecemeal deployments, language barriers with allied troops, and the horrors of
                artillery, shelling, and gas attacks.</p>
            <p class="section-text">Despite their bravery and daily risks for little more than pride, these heroes
                remained largely unrecognized after the war, neglected by the British Empire they served and overlooked
                by their homeland. Their sacrifices were further diminished by the British breaking their insincere
                promise of self-rule for India, leaving their contributions to the war effort undervalued.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-span-full battle-section">
            <h3 class="section-header">Western Europe Front</h3>
            <p class="section-text">In 1914, two critical battles, the Battle of Marne in September and the First Battle
                of Ypres in October, were pivotal for the Allies' survival. Had the German assaults been successful, the
                British Expeditionary Force (BEF) could have been forced to withdraw, potentially leading to a British
                defeat. The Indian Army played a crucial role in saving the BEF during these battles.</p>
            <p class="section-text">Indian soldiers captured by the Germans were treated better than those held by the
                Turks. The first mosque in Germany was even built for Indian POWs. Despite efforts by the Germans to
                encourage Indian soldiers to defect, only a few cases of defections to the enemy occurred. Additionally,
                over 300 POWs' voices were recorded and preserved by the Germans.</p>

        <div class="col-span-full battle-section">
            <h3 class="section-header">Indian Army Mobilization for the British</h3>
            <p class="section-text">In August 1914, the Indian Army Corps, the only professional army the British could
                rely on, mobilized for Europe via Karachi and Mumbai. For many Punjabi, Garhwali, and Gurkha soldiers,
                this was their first time seeing the sea and crossing the "Kala Pani" (Black Water), a significant
                cultural taboo for many Hindu soldiers.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-span-full battle-section">
            <h3 class="section-header">Princely States &amp; British Indian Army</h3>
            <p class="section-text">Princely States &amp; British Indian Army By 1914, one-third of India was governed
                by
                over 700 princely states. Through the Imperial Service Scheme, these states were allowed to train and
                equip portions of their forces to British standards, making them available for operations within the
                Indian Army. Among the 27 states maintaining Imperial Service Contingents, 21 participated in World War
                I, primarily in the Middle East, while 4 contributed forces to France.</p>
            <p class="section-text">During World War I, Indian nationalists believed that their support for the British
                war effort would lead to Dominion Status, akin to that of the "White Commonwealth." Mahatma Gandhi,
                having returned from South Africa in 1915, supported the war effort as he had previously in the Boer
                War. Meanwhile, poet Rabindranath Tagore expressed skepticism about nationalism, noting India's
                struggles, saying, "We, the famished, ragged ragamuffins of the East are to win freedom for all
                humanity!" India endured severe hardships during the war, including high taxation, inflation, economic
                losses from disrupted trade, and a devastating influenza epidemic that took many lives.</p>

        <div class="col-span-full battle-section">
            <h3 class="section-header">Impact of Post 1857 First War of Independence</h3>
            <p class="section-text">The reorganization of the military following the 1857 First War of Independence,
                also known as the "Sepoy Mutiny," penalized those who participated in the rebellion and rewarded those
                who remained loyal. Regiments that mutinied were disbanded, and the concept of "Martial Races" emerged,
                reshaping the composition of the Indian Army.</p>
            <p class="section-text">Before the mutiny, the Bengal Army predominantly consisted of plainsmen, including
                many Brahmins who had rebelled, unlike the Gurkhas who stayed loyal. This led to a shift in perception,
                with people from hilly regions or northern latitudes viewed as tougher, more honest, and "manlier" than
                those from the tropics or plains. Sikhs, although not hill-men, were favored for their northern origins
                and non-Hindu identity, alongside other communities in Punjab and the North.</p>
            <p class="section-text">These groups were considered more reliable, and the gaps left by disbanded regiments
                were filled by Gurkhas, Sikhs, and Punjabis. Under leaders like Roberts and Kitchener, the Indian Army
                was unified, with an increased proportion of soldiers drawn from the so-called Martial Races. Within 50
                years, Punjab became the cornerstone of the Indian Army, with representation from Sikhs, Dogras, Jats,
                Punjabi Mussalmans, Pathans, Gurkhas, and Garhwalis. However, the Martial Races theory, while
                influential, was largely based on unscientific and biased assumptions.</p>
