            <h3 class="section-header">Indian Cavalry in Haifa</h3>
            <p class="section-text">On September 23, 1918, during World War I, the Indian Cavalry captured Haifa, ending
                400 years of Ottoman rule. This victory enabled the local Christian and Jewish communities to flourish
                and contributed to the eventual formation of Israel. It also prevented the Ottomans from crucifying
                Abdu’l Baha on Mount Carmel and destroying the Baha'i faith shrines, while playing a crucial role in the
                broader success of Allenby’s forces in routing the Ottoman armies across Palestine, Lebanon, and Syria.
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">The 15th Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade, consisting of the Jodhpur Lancers, Mysore
                Lancers, and Hyderabad Lancers, was part of the 5th Cavalry Division of the Desert Mounted Corps. Tasked
                with capturing Haifa from Ottoman control, the brigade played a crucial role in the city's liberation.
                The victory came at a heavy cost, with 900 Indian soldiers sacrificing their lives. This battle marked a
                pivotal moment in World War I and the region’s future and is remembered as the last successful cavalry
                charge in military history.

            <h3 class="section-header">Events During the Liberation</h3>
            <p class="section-text">On September 22, 1918, a force of 700 Turkish soldiers from the Haifa garrison
                attempted to reach Tiberias but encountered the 13th Cavalry Brigade's outposts and were attacked by the
                18th Lancers. Many were killed, and 311 were captured, along with four machine guns. An aerial
                reconnaissance later suggested Haifa had been evacuated. On the same day, a detachment of Light Armoured
                Cars, led by Brigadier General A. D'A. King advanced along the Nazareth Road to occupy Haifa. However,
                they encountered barricades and came under artillery and machine gun fire from Mount Carmel, forcing
                them to withdraw with minor casualties.</p>
            <p class="section-text">On September 23, 1918, the 14th and 15th Cavalry Brigades handed over their line to
                the 3rd Australian Light Horse Brigade and began their march on Haifa. The route was restricted by the
                boggy terrain of the River Kishon, and the 15th Cavalry Brigade came under fire from 77mm guns
                positioned on Mount Carmel. By midday, the 14th Cavalry Brigade, along with divisional headquarters,
                successfully occupied the Kishon Railway Bridge and Harosheth of the Gentiles.
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">The Jodhpur Lancers, supported by 'B' Battery H.A.C., launched an attack on Haifa,
                encountering strong resistance. Despite intense machine gun fire, they made a successful charge.
                Meanwhile, a squadron of Mysore Lancers, supported by Sherwood Rangers, maneuvered over Mount Carmel,
                captured two naval guns on the Carmel ridge, and charged the enemy’s machine gun positions.

                    Singh, was to advance through the defile and seize the machine guns positioned on the eastern

                    Securing the defile was the pivotal operation upon the success of the entire battle.</p>

                    Beled

                    significant horse casualties. Lt. Col. Holden directed Maj. Dalpat to charge the machine guns on
                    Mount
                    Carmel’s lower slopes. During the maneuver, Maj. Dalpat was shot in the spine and later died

                    his
                    wounds. A previous reconnaissance had been disrupted, and upon reaching the river, they found
                    the
                    embankment impassable due to quicksand.</p>
                <p class="section-text">At a critical moment, Captain Bahadur Aman Singh took command and led a
                    fearless
                    charge, eliminating over 30 enemy troops and capturing two machine guns and two camel guns.
                    Their
                    decisive assault secured the narrow defile, clearing the road to Haifa. The 'B' Squadron
                    galloped
                    across
                    both branches of Wadi Ashlul el Wawy, charging into the enemy and securing the defile. This
                    strategic
                    breakthrough, via the Turkish bridge between Wadi Selman and the mountain, cleared the main road
                    into
                    Haifa for the regiment’s advance. After securing the defile, 'B' Squadron advanced along the
                    lower
                    slopes of Mount Carmel and stormed the German colony west of Haifa, seizing multiple machine
                    guns
                    and

            <p class="section-text">The city of Haifa, present-day Israel, located just north of Jerusalem on the
                Mediterranean coast, was strategically positioned between the steep slopes of Mount Carmel to the south
                and the Nahr el Muqatta (River Kishon) to the north. The narrow defile between the mountain and the
                river was heavily defended by Turkish artillery and gun emplacements.

            <h3 class="section-header">'Abdu'l-Baha</h3>
            <p class="section-text">‘Abdu’l-Baha, the son of the Founder of the Baha’i Faith and its spiritual leader,
                resided in Haifa, present-day Israel. The Baha’i Faith, which began in the Ottoman Empire in the 19th
                century, had grown in influence under ‘Abdu’l-Baha’s leadership and humanitarian efforts. Alarmed by his
                growing popularity, the Turkish commander-in-chief, Jamal Pasha, threatened to crucify ‘Abdu’l-Baha on
                Mount Carmel and destroy all Baha’i shrines and holy places.</p>
            <p class="section-text">When news of this threat reached the British community in Egypt and Europe, Major
                Tudor-Pole, a British army intelligence officer and follower of ‘Abdu’l-Baha, persuaded military
                authorities to intervene and protect him. With the liberation of Haifa in 1918, the danger to
                ‘Abdu’l-Baha’s life was finally lifted, preserving the Baha’i holy sites in Haifa and nearby Acre. Haifa
                had spiritual importance to the Bahá'í Faith, which had begun to grow within the Ottoman Empire. The
                spiritual leader, Abdu’l-Bahá, had attracted the Ottomans’ attention due to his humanitarian work,
                leading to a threat of his execution.</p>
