                        of Ottoman rule and securing the region for Christian and Jewish communities while preventing
                        the destruction of Baha'i shrines. Part of the 5th Cavalry Division, the 15th Imperial Service
                        Cavalry Brigade, including the Jodhpur, Mysore, and Hyderabad Lancers, played a key role in this
                        pivotal victory. The battle, which cost 900 Indian lives, contributed to the success of
                        Allenby’s forces in Palestine, Lebanon, and Syria and is remembered as the last successful
                        cavalry charge in military history.</p>

                <p class="section-text">On September 22, 1918, 700 Turkish soldiers from the Haifa garrison attempted to
                    reach Tiberias but were attacked by the 18th Lancers at the 13th Cavalry Brigade’s outposts. Many
                    were killed, and 311 were captured, along with four machine guns. Aerial reconnaissance later
                    confirmed Haifa's evacuation. Meanwhile, a detachment of Light Armoured Cars, led by Brigadier
                    General A. D'A. King, advanced to occupy Haifa but faced barricades, artillery, and gun fire from
                    Mount Carmel, forcing a withdrawal.</p>
                <p class="section-text">On September 23, 1918, the 14th and 15th Cavalry Brigades handed over their line
                    to the 3rd Australian Light Horse Brigade and began marching toward Haifa. The 15th Cavalry Brigade
                    faced fire from 77mm guns on Mount Carmel while crossing the boggy River Kishon. By midday, the 14th
                    Cavalry Brigade occupied the Kishon Railway Bridge and Harosheth of the Gentiles. The Jodhpur
                    Lancers with the 'B' Battery H.A.C. attacked Haifa. Meanwhile, the Mysore Lancers, supported by
                    Sherwood Rangers, captured two naval guns and charged enemy machine gun positions.</p>

                        the
                        final successful cavalry charge in military history during the war. He is remembered as the
                        "Hero of
                        Haifa" for his pivotal role in the city's liberation. For his bravery, he was posthumously
                        awarded
                        the Military Cross.</p>
                    <p class="section-text">At a critical moment, Major Dalpat entrusted the vital task of capturing the
                        defile to his most senior officer, Captain Bahadur Aman Singh. Leading a fearless charge,
                        Captain
                        Singh eliminated over 30 enemy troops and captured two machine guns and two camel guns. This
                        decisive assault secured the narrow defile, a pivotal operation for the success of the battle,
                        and
                        cleared the main road into Haifa.</p>
                    <p class="section-text">Brigadier Harbord ordered the Jodhpur Lancers to advance near Beled Esh
                        Sheikh
                        but came under fire crossing the Acre railway line. Lt. Col. Holden directed Major Dalpat to
                        charge
                        the machine guns on Mount Carmel’s lower slopes. During the maneuver, he was shot in the spine
                        and
                        later died.</p>

                    spiritual leader and resided in Haifa, present-day Israel. Under his leadership, the faith, which
                    originated in the Ottoman Empire in the 19th century, grew in influence through his humanitarian
                    efforts. Alarmed by his popularity, Turkish commander Jamal Pasha threatened to crucify him on Mount
                    Carmel and destroy all Bahá’í shrines.</p>
                <p class="section-text">With Haifa’s liberation, the threat to his life was averted, preserving Bahá’í
                    holy sites in Haifa and nearby Acre. Haifa held spiritual significance for the Bahá’í Faith, which
                    had grown within the Ottoman Empire. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s humanitarian work had drawn Ottoman attention,
                    leading to threats of his execution.</p>
